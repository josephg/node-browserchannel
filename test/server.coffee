  #   emit 'message', object. In this case, the server *also* emits the data as a map.
  # - The client can POST the forwardchannel data using a JSON blob. The message looks like this:
  #
  #     {ofs: 10, data:[null, {...}, 1000.4, 'hi', ....]}
  #
  #   In this case, the server *does not* emit a map, but merely emits the json object using emit 'message'.
  #
  #   To advertise this service, during the first test, the server sends X-Accept: application/json; ...
